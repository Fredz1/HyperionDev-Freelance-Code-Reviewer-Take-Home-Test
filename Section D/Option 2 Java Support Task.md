# Option 2: Java Support Task

To help the student with their problem, I would follow the following process:

1. Repeat the problem: I would repeat the problem the student is facing with the JOptionPane. ShowDialog() to ensure that I have a clear understanding of the issue.

1. Ask clarifying questions: I would ask clarifying questions to understand the exact error and the context in which it is happening, such as what they are trying to achieve with the do-while loop and what the code looks like.

1. Suggest a solution: Based on the information provided, I would suggest a solution. This could involve modifying the code to store the input in a way that ensures the do-while loop functions as intended.

1. Provide an explanation: I would provide an explanation of the solution and how it addresses the student's issue to help them understand the solution.

1. Confirm understanding: I would confirm that the student has understood the solution by asking them to explain it back to me in their own words.

1. Offer additional resources: If the student needs further assistance, I would offer additional resources such as tutorials or documentation to help them continue to work on the task.

1. Follow up: I would follow up with the student after some time to check their progress and see if they have any additional questions or issues.
